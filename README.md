# DeepHistFaces

DeepHistFaces is a hybrid face recognition system combining traditional (LBPH) and deep learning (CNN) techniques to achieve robust and accurate face recognition. It is designed to compare the performance of both methods and provide insights into their strengths and limitations.

# Features

1.Face image collection module using OpenCV.

2.Training module for LBPH and CNN models.

3.Comparison module to evaluate accuracy and confidence of both models.

4.Normalized output for LBPH distances and CNN probabilities.

5.Scalable and modular design.
